										<p>Lorem Ipsum is <strong>simply dummy text </strong>of the printing and
										typesetting industry.Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text
										ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
										scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
										centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
										unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
										containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
										software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
